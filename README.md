## Workday-Planner 

UCF Coding Bootcamp Week 3 Challange 1. 


This project was about utilizing JQuery to some experience with it's framework. I added JQuery to the script.js to make it so that date at the top of the page updates, the time blocks change accordingly, and functionality to save messages to the local storage and keep them on the page after a refresh.
